# Since roughly 2009 there have been no more release tarballs.
# However maintenance has moved to a publically-accessible
# repository:
#  https://code.google.com/p/scrypt/source/browse
# This can be accessed from the debian packaging repository, which
# uses git, via:
#  git config svn-remote.svn.url 'http://scrypt.googlecode.com/svn/trunk'
#  git config svn-remote.svn.fetch ':refs/remotes/svn/git-svn'
#  git svn fetch
# Unfortunately (a) point releases are not tagged, and (b) google code
# no longer supports downloading of tarballs from repo tags, due to
# abuse of that mechanism.  However, to date, the svn commits are atomic
# fixes that appear suitable for treatment as point releases.  For this
# reason they will be packaged as version+svn.r, where r is the svn
# commit number.
