Subject: configure.ac version

autoconf gets annoyed if configure.ac does not contain a literal
version argument in AC_INIT.  The upstream code tries to figure out
the version from the directory name and include it in.  This has a few problems:

* The code to do this is in Makefile, and is overwritten by autotools.
* The code doesn't work in Debian because the directory name does
  not necessarily encode the version.
* The file containing the version is not present in the upstream sources,
  and must be created by running "make", and autoconf fails if it is not
  found.
* The Makefile in the sources uses a syntactic extension not supported
  by GNU make, which errors out with "missing separator".

This patch passes a literal version number to AC_INIT.

BE SURE TO UPDATE FOR A NEW UPSTREAM VERSION!
